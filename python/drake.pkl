V\u000aThank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha\u000a

V\u000a[Verse 1: Drake]\u000aPart of me wished I can meet with\u000aAll you haters in person, they got a lot of\u000aFeelings for me they just ain't certain. How to\u000aExpress themselves when I walk into the club and\u000aTake stares like the fuckin elevators ain workin\u000aYeah. Cause they know the promoter pays you, you wouldn't\u000aHave come if somebody hadn't of made you, you just looking\u000aForward to seeing women that played you and shitting\u000aOn the men they get engaged to, I swear it's like. Uh\u000aMore confidence and less fear. We can discuss it further\u000aWhen y'all manage to get here. Diddy here, O here\u000aSkinny here, Rex here and we just having one of them conversations\u000aAbout next year. I`ma kill it, I promise that`s how I know you\u000aMad. I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads. The\u000aBig homie use a flash if you must and I swear I ain't asking\u000aFor much, all I want is the\u000a\u000a[Hook: Trey Songz]\u000aI want the money, money and the cars\u000aCars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose\u000aI just wanna be, I just wanna be successful\u000aI just wanna be, I just wanna be successful\u000aI just wanna be, I just wanna be successful\u000a\u000a[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]\u000aHip-hop is like school, yeah I had to\u000aLearn it. Beef is like a blank disc, yeah\u000aI had to burn it. They finally showing me\u000aRespect but I had to earn it. I'm heading to\u000aThe finishing line, ain't got no time for\u000aU-turns. Today I realise that I'm not perfect\u000aEverything I did to get here wasn't really worth it\u000aWhy won't they just let me be great. You fall down seven\u000aTimes you stand up eight. Realise true happiness lies\u000aInside of you. Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo\u000aThe birds singing after the motherfukin` storm gone. If you\u000aWant to sing, you can always sing this song. Turn my swag\u000aOn, this my theme song, there`s 95 per-cent chance that I used to\u000aBe your ringtone. I got swissel and cheese but I don't yodel\u000aHeart tatted on my neck they love my vocal\u000a\u000a[Hook: Trey Songz]\u000a\u000a[Verse 3: Soulja Boy]\u000aAs I sit back and spit this crack and leaking\u000aOn the internet and watch my haters react\u000a50 said they can't read between the lines so\u000aI jab, uppercut, punchline after punchline\u000aI know you thinking damn Soulja going hard\u000aRight now. And I'm thinking damn this is just the\u000aStart right now. Soulja Boy is going on a renegade\u000aIf life give you lemons make lemonade\u000a\u000a[Hook: Trey Songz]\u000a\u000a[Outro: Soulja Boy]\u000aUh, no one person on this earth can change their past\u000aBut every single person on this earth can start today\u000aAnd change their future. That`s real shit. Beezy\u000aSoulja Boy I tell 'em\u000a

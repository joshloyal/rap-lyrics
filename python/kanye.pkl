V\u000aYo, we made this joint, we was like, "We gotta get Preemo to scratch on this shit, seriously." Cause, that's one of my idols, just a legend in the game, a living legend. And then, plus, he, he like porn a lot, so I relate to him with that, you know. And he been to the AVN's, you know. I been to the Grammy's, he been to the AVN's, you know. I'm, and, actu- I'm envious of him, cause Rick Rubin, he actually asked me to go to the AVN's, and I was like, "Man, I can't do it. I just made 'Jesus Walks'. They gon' see me, and they gon' take away my NAACP award." So I was, uh, you know, I have to watch pornos in the privacy of my own home, you know? I really want to go AVN's, but, you know, I can't do it, cause they'll take me off the cover of Jet, and then what? Now I won't make it on the cover of Essence. But one day, one day I'll be there. I'ma have one on of them BAPE hoodies zipped-up with the eyes cut out and some, some gloves with the fingers cut off so I could feel, too, so I could touch. You know they let celebrities touch. That's how it be whenever you go to the strip club, "No touching! Except for you, 'Ye, you can do whatever you want."\u000a

VInterviews (Interlude)
p55
V\u000aThis is my problem with interviews, you know. What if you did music and someone else could come in and change your words around and then release it to the radio? And you don't even get a chance to listen to it before they dropped it to radio. That's how interviews are. You, you say what you say and then you'll get paraphrased and then they'll do shit like, if you say a joke, most jokes are inappropriate. They's, they're like fucked up things that you say but it's kind of funny the way you word 'em. And if you take away, you know, the setup or the punchline, you just sound absolutely crazy. Which is, they love to do that because I love to joke and I give them too much and then my shit don't be like all dry ass interviews and stuff, like I don't have media training or whatever. And then, so they take that, and I, and I told Gabe, I said look, well I wanna, I wanna do uh, I wanna get approval over the shit, just because I wanted to be as entertaining as possible, I want people to have the information. And you know, like a lot of magazines, they got real uptight, they like, "no you 'on't get approval, you 'on't get approval, you don't get approval." So, you know, when I say the line 'bout The Rolling Stone, I don't have a problem with Rolling Stone. I really appreciate the fact that they did put me on the magazine and I realize that you know I was halfway out of my mind for the past two years and shit. I was, you know, off that drug called fame and shit like that, I was really like, I was like a little crazy, you know what I'm sayin'\u000a

VJimmy Kimmel Interview Pt. 1
p537
V\u000aJimmy Kimmel: My guest tonight is a 21-time Grammy award winning performer, who last month threatened his very existence by threatening one of America's most beloved television personalities.  We had a big dumb fight on Twitter, but he was nice enough to agree to come and talk about it tonight.  Please welcome Kanye West!\u000a\u000a[Kanye enters]\u000a\u000aJK:  How are you?\u000a\u000aKanye West:  I'm okay.\u000a\u000aJK:  I'm very happy that you came.  I'm glad you did, and I wanted to clear this up.  I really felt bad about all this stuff.  I did.\u000a\u000aKW:  Mm-hmm. [Laughter]\u000a\u000aJK:  I guess the first question I should ask is, who are you wearing?\u000a\u000aKW: It's Ralph.\u000a\u000aJK: Kramden? Lauren?\u000a\u000aJK: Is that a new grill you have there?\u000a\u000aKW: Nah they've been in my mouth for three years.\u000a\u000aJK: That one on the bottom? OK well it's good to see you.\u000a\u000aKW: Good seeing you too.\u000a\u000aJK: I guess we should talk about what happened, because I do think that somewhere in you, you want people to understand where you\u2019re coming from is that true?\u000a\u000aKW: Yeah, correct.\u000a\u000aJK: So we did a sketch on the show where we had - you did an interview  with the BBC Radio and it was an intense interview - and I\u2019ll be honest with you, I only saw a couple of little parts of the [Zane Lowe] interview when we did this sketch.\u000a\u000aKW: Yeah, that\u2019s what I thought.\u000a\u000aJK: In fairness, there was context to it and we took it out of context. And we had a couple of little kids reenact it. Which I didn\u2019t think would be something that bothered you. Do you mind if we show a little clip of it?\u000a\u000aLittle Kanye: I've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. I'm not trying to regurgitate myself. I'm a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could think about! Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no! How many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants?!\u000a\u000aJK: I'm gonna tell you something, the truth is the main reason I did that is because I like to see kids curse. I think it\u2019s funny. (*Kanye laughs*) And I think that some people read into it differently that we were positioning you as a child, but that\u2019s not true. In fact, we\u2019ve done this to other people, with Lady Gaga, with quite a few people that we've had kids say what they said and reenact them. Of course this is not something you knew. And this is not something that people who just watched it online or whatever knew. And you called me. A lot of people think this is some kind of publicity stunt that you and I cooked up. But this isn't, right?\u000a\u000aKW: I mean everyone out there in TV world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know that I\u2019ve never done a publicity stunt in my life. Any time I went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was always what I thought was the truth. Whether I'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever I felt emotionally. I don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to say. So I don\u2019t do publicity stunts, period. So don\u2019t ever think that.\u000a\u000aJK: Me neither guys. (Laughter) So we talked on the phone, and I didn\u2019t really know why you were calling. I heard you were upset. But I didn't know the context, and we had a bad conversation, right?\u000a\u000aKW: Yeah, I knew you before. And I saw you at a wedding and I remember you telling me, I want people to know this side of you and different things like this and I saw this good guy at the wedding. So when I saw the skit - which I didn't watch all the way through because I didn't want to be infuriated - I was like I know you. So it was a combination of me knowing you, but also me NOT knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of In Touch. And me not knowing this person. So I was like this is the one person I know. So I can go and let out everything that I feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people feel is ok to treat celebrities like zoo animals or act like what they're saying is not serious, or their life is not serious or their dreams are not serious. And you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just had as men\u2026 that elevates sometimes, you take a guy, Jimmy does his thing. And I do my thing and at a certain point these egos can flare up and we kind of just took it back to high school for a minute.\u000a\u000aJK: And I got beat up a lot in high school, So I didn't wanna go back to high school.\u000a\u000aJK: And this is something that to be honest with everyone, this is something that when you're with another celebrity we complain about. This zoo animal, it's a perfect thing, because people online they just want you to click through so they'll put whatever they can put as a headline to get you to click through and it can be damaging and I think people look at you and they go, "this is a guy who\u2019s got millions of dollars, he's got a beautiful wife and a new baby, we can\u2019t possibly hurt this guy." And to be honest, even though I\u2019m in that same position too - I don't have a baby - it\u2019s not something that comes to my mind when I\u2019m cooking up a comedy sketch. And some of these things are hurtful, and the truth is important. And it's... but on the other hand, I will say a lot of times you I think you bring it on yourself, this kind of misunderstanding about you.\u000a\u000aI personally found it odd to be in the position that I was in because I often\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you know this, a lot of people think you\u2019re a jerk. And I often, in my own personal conversations, say, no, I know this guy, he is not a jerk. In fact I think we have a picture which I happened to see on my Dad's iPad at the wedding and it's you and my Dad [*shows a photo of Kanye with Kimmel's dad] - who you may have though was Wolf Blitzer in fairness - but I mean to go to a wedding of a friend of mine and you took a Southwest Airlines flight to that wedding just to make it for this guy who was just a coworker and then to be so nice to everyone there, that tells me a lot about you. Everyone's nice to me when they meet me because they know I have a talk show and almost everyone's on their best behavior. But what I observe is how celebrities behave around other people - how they treat our staff and how they treat in this case my family, and I\u2019ve always said that to people about you. And I think that's important for... I know part of you doesn\u2019t care, I see you onstage saying, "I don\u2019t want to hold your baby, I\u2019ll drop your baby on it\u2019s head\u2026" you know I don\u2019t believe any of that stuff when you say it.\u000a\u000aKW: I\u2019m not running for office, I\u2019m just here to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music. And you know when I did that [Zane Lowe] interview, I was really vocal about a lot of things that I've been dealing with over the past 10 years, when I was put in the classification of \u201cjust a celebrity.\u201d Because you know for me, I\u2019m a creative genius and there\u2019s no other way to word it. I know you\u2019re not supposed to say that about yourself, and I say things the wrong way a lot of times but my intention is always positive and I wanna bring more things to the world, I want to help the world. I want to make peoples\u2019 lives easier. I spent 2 of my checks in telemarketing when I was 18 years old on a pair of Gucci slippers, and this is before there was H&M and Zara, you couldn\u2019t just find cool stuff when you were growing up. And for me, I care about cool stuff. It means something to me, it means stuff to a lot of people that are like me, and that\u2019s what I was talking about on the Zane interview.\u000a\u000aSo when I come on here, I can laugh and I can joke, and I can see a skit and we can say, ok we love Kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, it\u2019s bigger than who I am and my presence, living. It\u2019s about when I was on Earth what did I do to help? And at what point did I hit a glass ceiling where people said you\u2019re a celebrity so you can\u2019t help in this box, you can\u2019t help in this box. But I talked to Quincy Jones at John Legend\u2019s wedding, and you do music, you can do anything. Once you learn how to produce, you\u2019re a producer, you understand textures and colors. I have an art background even before I was a musician. People told me I couldn\u2019t rap. People had all this advice for me about how I shouldn't try to rap. And I wouldn\u2019t even say I\u2019m a rapper, I\u2019m more of a messenger than a rapper.\u000a\u000aSo even when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what I said. Whereas if you look at the Zane interview, it\u2019s really something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do. Because most people just like bow down to TV or bow down to these cameras. Like I could care less about any of these cameras, all I care about is my family, I care about protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and my dreams. And ya know that's the reason why I went so crazy.\u000a\u000aJK: I wanna go back to one thing you said which is when you say you\u2019re a genius that upsets people, but the truth is a lot people think they\u2019re geniuses, and nobody says it because it\u2019s weird to say it, but it is most certainly more honest to say "I am a genius"\u2026\u000a\u000aKW: I\u2019m totally weird, and I\u2019m totally honest, and I\u2019m totally inappropriate sometimes. And the thing is for me to say I wasn\u2019t a genius, I would just be lying to you and to myself.\u000a\u000aJK: That's true, it\u2019s false humility.\u000a\u000aKW: Oh my god. It comes with your first ticket to LA, soon as you get off the plane, here\u2019s your false humility. Maybe if keep up with this act long enough and go with this agency they'll give you a star on the Walk of Fame one day for kissing everybody's ass. But it's like that's not what we're doing. By the way, I want to shoutout the Walk of Fame,  because they said something like they\u2019re not gonna put my girl on the Walk of Fame because she\u2019s a reality star. It's like people are so so dated and not modern. There\u2019s no way a Kim Kardashian shouldn\u2019t have a star on the Walk of Fame. Its ridiculous old concepts. And you know for me, I\u2019m just gonna give y\u2019all the truth. It\u2019s like my grandfather loved Ali until he died, and my grandmother hated Ali \u2019til she passed. So you\u2019re gonna love me or you\u2019re gonna hate me, but I\u2019m gonna be me.\u000a\u000a[Applause]\u000a\u000aJK: Alright, Kanye West is here, more with Kanye when we come back.\u000a\u000aAnnouncer: The best tweets of Kanye West.\u000a\u000aJosh Groban: Can we please toast to the motherfuckin' douchebags tonight? Do you know where to find marble conference tables? Looking to have a conference... not until I get the table though.\u000a\u000aAt most his tweets are 140 characters, but the depth of his passion is immeasurable.\u000a\u000aFur pillows are hard to actually sleep on. Man... what ever happened to my antique fish tank?\u000a\u000aAnnouncer: You'll get all of your favorites\u000a\u000aJosh Groban: Classical music is tight yo. I make awesome decisions in bike stores. French fries are the devil. Black is the new black.\u000a\u000aAnnouncer: And many many more. Josh Groban's the best tweets of Kanye West includes 752 original songs on 48 CDs.\u000a\u000aJosh Groban: I love me!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u000a\u000aAnnouncer: In stores now.\u000a

V\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aSo now, that was funny, right?\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aI imagine the skit was probably funny too.\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aIt wasn\u2019t that funny, to be honest with you. It was a five, I\u2019d give it.\u000a\u000aSo I do want to ask you one more thing about the tweets because I just want to be clear--bring up that...yeah, that--do you really think I look like SpongeBob?\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aIt\u2019s the first thing that came to my mind.\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aWhere were you when you were writing those tweets. I like to imagine, on the toilet.\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aYeah, that\u2019s when I think of the best shit.\u000a\u000aI was just at my place here, my old home here in LA. As we were writing it, there was a frustration I was getting out, but also they were really funny to me as I was writing it, and I just thought it was so amazing that I was saying this in real time, in real life. You know, with my position, people are so scared to say anything, you know, as soon as you\u2019re a celebrity, you\u2019re not to say anything anymore. But just to completely wild out\u2026\u000a\u000aThe only reason I could do that is because we could speak on a similar level, and we can go back and forth.\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aIt was a crazy thing, to see that happen, as far as just the technology, and all of a sudden, everyone in the country knew you and I were having a really dumb fight.\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aI just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a way. You know, I feel that media does everything they can to break creatives, to break artists, to break people\u2019s spirits, and I do everything I can to break media.\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aFrom my standpoint, sometimes I\u2019ll think of things and maybe it\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning on Saturday night, and my wife will go, \u201cDon\u2019t tweet that. Do not tweet that.\u201d Because people take things out of context, but you just do it, you don\u2019t care.\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aYou shoulda saw the second set of tweets\u2026\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aSave them for next time.\u000a\u000aI do just want to say congratulations on your new baby. In fact, I brought you a little gift. I made fun of this, but there really is such a thing as leather jogging pants, and there\u2019s some tiny little leather jogging pants\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aFashion isn\u2019t always practical. It\u2019s more about emotion, it\u2019s more about swag. It\u2019s more about, you know, pussy. It\u2019s more about, like, club. It\u2019s more about style and stuff.\u000a\u000aI remember me and my boy Virgil, that created the line Pyrex Vision. We sat as interns at Fendi like six years ago. We had cue cards and everything, and the leather jogging pants is one of the things we presented that didn\u2019t go through, and the reason I brought that up in the Zane interview is because there are people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants. It became  a phenomenon over the past three years. And it was to say, you know, I would sit with Hedi Slimane, who\u2019s now the head designer of Saint Laurent, and he\u2019d say, \u201cStop giving these  big brands your ideas and everything.\u201d And it would just be like, what I was trying to express in the Zane interview was, like, me--I know I\u2019m hip hop, and a rapper and everything--but I\u2019ve got ideas that mean something if I could put the proper production around them. So when do a Nike Yeezy or a Louis Vuitton shoe, the production around it was at the same level as the production on my CD, or when me and Rick Rubin or Mike Dean of whoever are working together. But if I go out and make my own t-shirt or something, and I call it \u201cKanye,\u201d everybody\u2019s gonna think about when I just called myself a creative genius, and say \u201cWhat\u2019s so genius about this?\u201d But when people line up for the Yeezy, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, wow, this is like really genius.\u201d You need that production.\u000a\u000aBut currently in fashion and the way the fashion world works, there\u2019s no black guy at the end of the runway in paris, in all honesty. And that\u2019s what I was talking about when the Truman Show hit the boat.\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aWhat about a Steve Harvey collection?\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aYeah, no. There\u2019s no Steve Harvey collection. No extra buttons on jackets or anything like that.\u000a\u000aBut for Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson had to fight to get his videos on MTV because he was considered to be \u201curban.\u201d This is Michael Jackson.\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aThat\u2019s true. He was considered a Black artist and was not right for MTV at that time.\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aYeah, a black artist. So, for me, think about this: When I\u2019m in Paris and I\u2019m sitting in Fashion Week for nine years, and South Park makes fun of our outfits and all this, or people don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re there, I\u2019m getting called names. Like stuff you can\u2019t even say on TV. And I still can\u2019t break that wall down. At a certain point, it\u2019s like, Michael Jackson trying to get his videos on because, who do you know who\u2019s known more for clothes than me? To not be able to do and produce to the highest level, and to have a meeting with everyone. I\u2019m talking about Andrew Rosen of Theory, this guy over here, this guy who runs this company, Leanne ???.  These are the real people who produce the clothes that are on your back. Zara, out there with Ortega, Francois Pinault, everyone. And everyone just sort of looks at you  like you\u2019re crazy and like you don\u2019t crash the Internet. And you\u2019re just like, \u201cHow can you get a shot?\u201d And then you try to do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for a rapper, and you just cannot overcome it.\u000a\u000aI mean, my grandfather drove the first cars in the marches just to get clean water, and one of the parallels  I wanted to do for you is, like, Richard Pryor used to always talk about, he just wanted a clean plate. He just wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate.  So if I do an interview in W Magazine, right, and they take all these classist shots at me because--it\u2019s not about racism anymore; it\u2019s classism, that\u2019s what I talked about.\u000a\u000aPaula Deen, she was old-school with it. They\u2019re like, \u201cWe don\u2019t do it like that anymore, Paula Deen. We\u2019re classist now.\u201d So this classism is what they do to try to say, \u201cYou\u2019re a rapper,\u201d or \u201cYour girl\u2019s on a reality show. You\u2019re not up here with us. You know, we\u2019re old money, we--\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aIt\u2019s snobbery--\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aIt\u2019s snobbery. And I\u2019m not into all that snobbery. Because, you know what? We have the loudest voice, we have the loudest communication, and all we want to do is make awesome stuff. All we want is a real shot.  Not: OK, I\u2019m a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt. No, I understand about quality. I understand about fabrics. I spent ten thousand hours at this. I\u2019ve dedicated my life to this. And a lot of people say, \u201cOK, you have to do music.\u201d I\u2019m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me I couldn\u2019t rap, what woulda happened? What if people told me I couldn\u2019t perform. I\u2019m only 36 years old; I have other goals and other things.  And I\u2019m gonna use my platform,  every platform, to stand up and say, \u201cI want to make something, I want to make the next Ralph Lauren.\u201d That was the point of the Zane interview, to say, people don\u2019t stand up to protect their dreams. People are too scared of getting, you know, spoofed in a way. [Turns to Kimmel]\u000a\u000aAnd the irony of it is, think about a creative person in school. When you picture them, you\u2019re probably picturing them all the way in the back of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and I\u2019m the one creative, and this is the reason why I did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there\u2019s moments when I stood up to drug dealers in Chicago and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have my publishing. Come and kill me. Do whatever you\u2019re gonna do, but you\u2019re not going to bully me, you\u2019re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.\u201d No matter how many people tell me, \u201cStop believing in yourself! Stop seeing what you can do! Stop affirming what you\u2019re gonna do and then completing that in real life.\u201d That\u2019s the improper way to do it. I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way they control people  with low self-esteem. With improper information, with branding, with marketing\u2026 I refuse to follow those rules.\u000a\u000aIt\u2019s about truth, it\u2019s about information, it\u2019s about awesomeness, and the only luxury is time. The time you spend with your family, that\u2019s the only luxury. So this concept of \u201cluxury\u201d is improper to me. You know, with Nike, with Apple, you remember there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! Somebody pull out a Vertu phone right now, you look ridiculous, but there\u2019s people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, \u201cOh, we\u2019re better than you.\u201d I mean, taste, culture, art, you know, just the quality of your life. This is what I\u2019m here to do, so  when I compare myself to Steve Jobs or Walt Disney, Howard Hughes, David Stern, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Jesus of whatever it is, I\u2019m saying, \u201cThese are my heroes. These are people I look up to. This is the type of impact I want to make on the earth.\u201d If I can make this type of impact up to this point, what can I do, if you call Bob Iger and say, \u201cYo, give him a shot.\u201d If you call Oprah and say, \u201cYo, back this kid. This kid, his parents were educators. He wants to educate. He wants to look at curriculums and say, \u2018How do we simplify that?\u2019\u201d\u000a\u000aExactly what I did in music, I want to apply to product, I want to apply to education. This is what my company Donda is about. I could rap all I want, but without that Roc-a-Fella chain, and Damon giving me that Roc-a-Fella chain. I don\u2019t care how beats I sold to whoever, I couldn\u2019t have made it to the point to make \u201cJesus Walks.\u201d And now, even as a celebrity,  I\u2019ve reached a ceiling. And the way paparazzi talk to me and my family is disrespectful, also. We bring something of joy to the world. When people hear my music they have a good time. And I should be respected as such when I walk down the street. Don\u2019t ask me a question about something you say in a tabloid. Don\u2019t try to antagonize me. Cause, you know what, it\u2019s not safe for you in this zoo. Never think that I\u2019m not from Chicago for one second. And think you can walk right up and disrespect me and my family constantly.\u000a\u000aAnd people say, \u201cWell, you signed up to be a celebrity, blah blah blah\u2026\u201d It\u2019s like, you know what, and I understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it\u2019s hard out here, but let\u2019s have respect for each other. You do help me get money, paparazzi,  you show people how fresh my outfit is, that helps me influence people.\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aBut when they show up at your house in the middle of the night, and your wife and your daughter are there, there\u2019s no human decency there.\u000a\u000a[Kanye]\u000aIt\u2019s a lack of decency.\u000a\u000a[Kimmel]\u000aKanye West, everybody.\u000a

VTupac Shakur - Rolling Stone Entry

V\u000aEvery rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to 2Pac. People either try to emulate him in some way, or they go in a different direction because they didn't like what he did. But whatever you think of him, he definitely developed his own style: He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.\u000a\u000aMy favorite 2Pac album is The Don Killuminati. It was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. It was like a doctor told him he was going to die, and he was trying to get it all down on paper. That's something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept, and stay in that negative space. Everybody knows that they're going to die. But after you're in a life-threatening situation, you think about it a little more.\u000a\u000a2Pac's aggressive records are my favorite. "Hail Mary" is just perfect: "Picture paragraphs unloaded/Wise words being quoted." Most artists now just aren't smart enough to write that, or honest enough to write a line like, "I ain't a killer but don't push me." These days rappers will just tell you, "I'll kill you."\u000a\u000a2Pac was like a camera. It's incredible how much he wrote \u2014 how much he documented. To me, 'Pac was more of a poet than a rapper. You can always tell when you're hearing 2Pac verse. He wrote those lyrics without any music. Notorious B.I.G. was more melody-driven \u2014 I'm sure he wrote his shit without a pen, and over the music \u2014 but 'Pac was just hashing out his life. The thing was, he was doing that when the public eye was on him, and everything he was hashing out just expanded, and that's when things got out of control.\u000a\u000aAll of us on the East Coast loved 2Pac. The music was all that mattered. That East Coast/West Coast feud was just personal beef. Now that he's not here, he's bigger than ever. I can still listen to two or three 2Pac CDs straight. Sometimes I put on 2Pac's best songs, followed by Biggie's best songs. Then I get ready to go into my next project.\u000a\u000aLaurence Fishburne told me once that he didn't like 2Pac. He told me it was because 2Pac was so much smarter than everyone around him. He said he didn't like the way 2Pac behaved because he knew that 2Pac knew better. I understood what he meant. But I still gave him a look like he was bugging.\u000a

V\u000aWhen Eminem and I did "Stan" at the Grammys in 2001, we got together to rehearse out in the Valley. We had never met or really spoken, so I was a little intimidated. When we started to do the song and Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, "Fuck, this man is amazing." There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time \u2014 only the greats.\u000a\u000aEminem is a true poet of his time, someone we'll be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, he's one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out. That's why we look forward to listening to Eminem's lyrics and finding out where the hell he's headed next.\u000a\u000aEminem lives, sleeps and breathes music \u2014 he's a bit like me in that respect. He's pretty much a recluse. I think he's enthralled with what he's doing; he's intimately involved with his art. There's a mystique about him. From the start, I have always admired Eminem's thinking. That's the reason I wanted to appear on the Grammys with him when I was asked, despite all the nonsense talked about his being homophobic and crap like that. The Boy Georges of the world all got up in a twist about it. If they didn't have the intelligence to see his intelligence, that was their problem.\u000a\u000aEminem has the balls to say what he feels and to make offensive things funny. That's very necessary today, when irony is becoming a lost art. Artists like Eminem who use their free speech to get a point across are vitally important. There just aren't many people in the world with balls that big and talent that awesome.\u000a

VJay-Z - Rolling Stone Entry
p689
V\u000aSomewhere between LOL and FML there was "TRL." MTV's Total Request Live debuted in September 1998. The early TRL charts were dominated by 'N Sync, the Backstreet Boys, Korn and their respective biters. Then, six weeks in, Jay-Z's "Can I Get A ... " video debuted at Number 10. It wasn't the beginning of his career as a rapper, but it was the beginning of his career as a major force in pop music.\u000a\u000aMainstream radio and TV presented the late-Nineties teenager with a weirdly extreme choice between aggro rock played by men in tank tops and mushy ballads sung by slightly smaller men in tank tops; Jay-Z presented a much-needed alternative. This is not to say that Jay-Z never wore tank tops, but he was (and continues to be) an exceedingly rare combination of intelligence, weirdness, seriousness and pop appeal. Go look back at those TRL charts and it's not hard to tell why a generation of musicians, critics and fans became so deeply connected to the lyrics of a dude who, supposedly, was describing a world that at least 50 percent of his fans "couldn't relate to."\u000a\u000aIn my lifetime, Jay-Z has, by far, been the most artful and exciting musician to consistently make hits, and I mean real hits \u2014 Top 10 singles deep into his career, like "Empire State of Mind." How many artists make it 15 years without embarrassing themselves, let alone while maintaining their relevancy?\u000a\u000aI remember getting chills watching him perform "On to the Next One" at Coachella. He was wearing all black and standing in front of a giant video wall. I interpret that song as both an ode to creative ingenuity and a critique of infinite-growth capitalism. Admittedly, I was reading a lot about peak oil at the time, but c'mon, who else can inspire a crowd of 100,000 to throw their arms in the air while offering each individual brain in that crowd the opportunity to think critically about language and the state of the world today?\u000a\u000aHis lyrics are deep enough to demand exegesis (see: Decoded), at times, cute and playful enough to be memorized by every "mean girl" at my high school (see: his verse on Mariah Carey's "Heartbreaker"). On "Public Service Announcement," he described himself as being like "Che Guevara with bling on." Some people found this to be in bad taste, but it doesn't feel too off the mark to me. At the very least, I don't think anyone will take issue with the next line: "I'm complex."\u000a

V\u000aSo many people get caught up in trying to remake their first album and it's impossible for me to make another College Dropout, but I could make the best Graduation and best 808's that I could make.

p734
V\u000aI got off the phone with this one dude. I guess he used to run a multi-billion dollar company or something like that and he had some advice for me, right. He said, 'I don't approve of your methods in your interviews lately.' He said he only saw one person before who ever really pulled this off and that was Muhammad Ali. But he said if he could just give me some advice, he doesn't approve of the way I'm going about things as of late. And when anybody that's supposed to have a lot of money talks to me and they give me advice, I call that free advice, because they're trying to tell me what to do and they ain't cut no check yet. If I look to the side of me, or the other side of me, or if I look to the Internet or if I'm reading, and I don't see somebody that 36-years-old that made it this far with nobody that told they couldn't do it this much. Because the people that give me advice... I don't see them rocking for 15,000 motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight. And I don't know if y'all have heard of [Nikola] Tesla, and I'm not talking about the car, I'm talking about the inventor. Or if y'all ever heard about [Alejandro] Jodorowsky, the director who made Holy Mountain. But there's so many amazing creative inventors who weren't recognized in their time. And if I've got the voice and I've got the opportunity to turn up in these interviews, I just have to look and say, 'What do I have to lose?' What do I have to lose? We only have everything to gain. So don't ever let them make you think for one moment that I'm going insane. Because I sit back and see shit and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy?' But every celebrity is so goddamn scared of losing everything, that they won't ever say nothing to you. And y'all see that shit too. I gotta keep it so true for you... Because when I say 'creative genius,' I'm not saying that as a compliment to myself. I'm saying that because it's a burden to myself when these ideas keep me up at night. When you wanna give the world more and your ideas keep you up at night. When you wanna give the world so much more, so much more. And then nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. And nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. They'd rather see the headline and be on some bullshit than to give me one little chance. Than to give me one little, little, little chance. Than to give me one little chance despite the advance out of Tesla's basement, despite the advance out of me saying Jodorowsky's name and ya'll don't know who the fuck he is when everybody copied off of him... And there's gonna be motherfuckers in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off of him...I love y'all so much you don't even understand. Because y'all help me to talk all this shit. Because when I be on the phone with these people that used to run companies and they're trying to tell me how to be me, y'all give me the power to talk my shit. And I swear to you, this is only the motherfucking beginning. And anybody who [says], 'Oh, he's the best of rap.' That's racist. And that's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing and putting motherfuckers in a box. And putting creative niggas in a box. If you believe you can do anything, please raise your hands up tonight. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands in the sky. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands so high. And I wish you could see my tears right now. Put your hands up high. I wish you could feel my pain right now. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. These dreams keep me up at night. Dreams keep me up at night\u000a

V\u000aWait a second, would you rather me not talk at all? \u2019Cause I don\u2019t want to like, I don\u2019t want to rattle no cages or nothing, I don\u2019t want to like, I don\u2019t want to get in trouble. I want to be scared. I\u2019m trying my best to be scared. I\u2019m trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don\u2019t want to talk. I don\u2019t want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I\u2019m just going to tip-toe on this\u000a\u000aI\u2019m scared of anonymous comments online. I\u2019m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn\u2019t give me already. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared.  I\u2019m so shook. I\u2019m so, so scared. So scared. Soooo\u000a\u000aYou ain\u2019t never seen, you ain\u2019t ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y\u2019all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y\u2019all for giving me this moment in time. \u2019Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There\u2019s so many people have a moment and they don\u2019t own it\u000a\u000aYou know, it\u2019s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there\u2019s the connotation of that. But what I need y\u2019all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y\u2019all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y\u2019all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius\u000a\u000a\u2019Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it\u2019s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you\u2019re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you\u2019re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth\u000a\u000aYou watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they\u2019re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren\u2019t going to talk about the money we made. They\u2019re going to talk about the impact we had. They\u2019re going to talk about the impact we had\u000a\u000aAnd being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, \u201cBaby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.\u201d And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn\u2019t be no song called \u201cNiggas in Paris\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for Lenny Kravitz. \u2019Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. Star\u000a\u000aBut what\u2019s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. \u2019Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don\u2019t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long time\u000a\u000aAnd the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he\u2019s at the such and such show, and that\u2019s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you can\u000a\u000aSo I said, \u201cWait a second, though.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,\u201d and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said,  \u201cLenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.\u201d They said, \u201cLenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.\u201d Don\u2019t let me sing because I want y\u2019all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, \u201cHey that\u2019s cute, that\u2019s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.\u201d Like it\u2019s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn\u2019t be no Kanye west if it wasn\u2019t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I\u2019m saying?\u000a\u000aBut the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don\u2019t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don\u2019t want to break their motherfucking cool, don\u2019t nobody want to look like a fool\u000aMy boy [?], who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn\u2019t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don\u2019t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they\u2019re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I\u2019m saying, like I\u2019m actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I\u2019m saying, like I\u2019m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I\u2019m saying? Have y\u2019all ever read or heard someone say, \u201cI don\u2019t like Kanye West\u201d?\u000a\u000aI\u2019ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I\u2019m like, \u201cDamn, I wish I could be likeable like them.\u201d I wish people would like me like that\u000a\u000aSo what they basically did was, at Fashion Week\u2026 Let me explain something to you\u2026 I don\u2019t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That\u2019s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalized\u000a\u000aSo if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn\u2019t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he\u2019s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let\u2019s rewind, is above a music producer, and it\u2019s above a rapper\u000a\u000a\u2019Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can\u2019t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you\u2019re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, \u201cI am a god!\u201d Just for them to let you a little bit up\u000a\u000aBut you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell\u2019s such a nice guy. \u2019Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted\u2014I didn\u2019t price it, but the world reacted to it\u2014I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this [gestures back to his stage setup], that\u2019s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. West, but you\u2019re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You\u2019re not going to be able to create anything else again.\u201d They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and I said, \u201cBut wait a second. I sold out.\u201d They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.\u201d\u000a\u000aAnd right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. \u2019Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? \u2019Cause that\u2019s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?\u000a\u000aAnd what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I\u2019m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin\u2019 tight jeans that you want. I\u2019m the nigga that, you know I\u2019m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can\u2019t go to Riccardo\u2019s show and you can\u2019t go to Phoebe\u2019s show\u000a\u000aBut he wouldn\u2019t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn\u2019t say that to [?]. And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y\u2019all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what\u2019s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do tell me I can\u2019t go to these shows again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I\u2019m a musician, I don\u2019t have any ideas for clothing again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?\u000a\u000aBut I\u2019mma tell y\u2019all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit.  And I\u2019mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain\u2019t gonna steal from people\u2019s ideas like H&M. And we ain\u2019t gonna steal people\u2019s ideas like Zara. We gon\u2019 make our own shit. We gon\u2019 combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon\u2019 take them from Harvard, and we gon\u2019 take them from St. Mark's, and we gon\u2019 take \u2019em from the street\u000a\u000aAnd I\u2019m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin\u2019 hit song tonight. I\u2019m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin\u2019 hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I\u2019m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song\u2026\u000a\u000aHold up, hold up. I\u2019m sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin\u2019 now! Almost forgot that part\u000a

V\u000aHow many of you people came here with someone you love tonight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. Hold on, hold on. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on, hold on. Hold on tonight\u000a\u000aTonight I was thinking about being as safe as possible, I don't want to say nothing politically incorrect. [???] A very safe musician. I've been thinking about it. I've been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the most\u000a\u000aYou know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. [?]. It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?\u000a\u000aI had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney. I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison. I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream. And I'm not afraid to dream out loud. You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think you're crazy, or that you're stupid, or that you're foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks you're losing your mind, but I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind! I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what I'm saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than that's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true\u000a\u000aCause there's only two types of people, there's dreamers and there's haters. There's dreamers and there's haters. And all I've been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low. [?] I find [?], cause I feel like I just try sometimes. And I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid at all. THEY CAN'T STAND ME! THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!!! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!\u000a\u000aI ain't saying, when I say you I'm talking about public perception, I'm talking about backlash, I'm talking about all the tools they use to hold dreamers back, to make them look like motherfucking lunatics. How many people you know, that you talk to on a day to day basis, that made a motherfucking mountain open up in Tampa tonight? So all the other shit I'm talking about, is it crazy or is it possible? Put your hands up if you think anything is possible. Put your hands up if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible. Cause God made us in his image. And God made us all artists as children, God made us all artists as children. And somehow that peer pressure takes the artist out of you. Somehow the world can leave you so [?] confused, and you forget who you are. But I'm remembering, I'm remembering, I'm remembering\u000a\u000aCause most people, you know they say, they say people in my position, what ever that position is, like a celebrity or you make money, you have some type of status or some shit, you don't wanna fuck it up right? You don't wanna ruin your name, you don't wanna say anything wrong. So what you do is you get on TV you just smile, you just wave, and you try to be as safe as possible, cause you don't wanna fuck up enough, BUT I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!!! I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP! I WANNA FUCK UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 'CAUSE I'm STILL BEATING! As long as my heart is beating, as long as I'm dreaming. And I'mma stay kicking and dreaming, kicking and screaming, kicking and dreaming\u000a\u000aI feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. And I stand here, the Gemini that I am, and there are so many examples throughout our history: Miles Davis, Biggie Smalls, Lauren Hill, Prince, 2Pac. The Gemini that I am, it is my responsibility to turn up and tell you the truth. And if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, and if I, if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, the rest of the time, what the fuck were they telling you? If I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, what the FUCK were they telling you?!? What the fuck are they telling? So don't let nobody kill your dreams, don't let nobody tell you what you can do. Cause the more you accomplish, the more they wanna say you look like a fool. Following what you want to tonight, and you gotta an opportunity in the world\u000a\u000aHow many people are under 20 tonight? How many people are under 30 tonight? Under 40, under 50, under 60, GOD DAMMIT YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ARE LIVING, YOU ARE BREATHING, SO [??] YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THIS WORLD!!!\u000a

Don\u2019t let nobody but you\u000a\u000aYou know, people be looking at me like I got a problem or something. Like I\u2019m uncontrollable or something. Like I don\u2019t do what I\u2019m supposed to do. You know it\u2019s like they want to have everybody so brainwashed. They want to control everybody, you know, rumors, lies, media, marketing. It\u2019s like they want to steal you from you, and sell you back to you after they stole it. They want to make you feel like you less than who you really are\u000a\u000aCuz as far as I\u2019m concerned everybody\u2019s a star. See they want to make you feel like you less than you really are. Cuz as far as I\u2019m concerned everybody\u2019s a star\u000a\u000aYou know, uh, the first thing they do is crush your dreams. Crush your dreams. Then add a couple drops of low self-esteem. And then I don\u2019t think everything is what it seems. And control you with lies. And control you with lies\u000a\u000aYou know Imma tell you something, first thing they do is crush your dreams. Then let\u2019s add a couple, a couple of drops of low esteem. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. And they control you with lies. We goin\u2019 out of control tonight. We goin\u2019 out of control tonight. Ahh\u000a\u000aHow many people tonight with a show of hands think they are fucking awesome? [Crowd cheers]\u000a\u000aNow with a show of hands: How many people tonight have had people tell you your whole life that you wasn\u2019t fucking awesome? [Crowd cheers]\u000a\u000aSee this is what I\u2019m talking about.This is what I\u2019m talking about. This is what I\u2019m talking about. I mean, this is what I\u2019m talking about, this is what I\u2019m talking about\u000a\u000aHow many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they\u2019ll say, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I\u2019m a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they\u2019re trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a word or not, but it\u2019s now a word, cuz I said it\u2019s a fucking word \u2014 and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y\u2019all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager \u2026 how many people want to contribute something to the world?\u000a\u000aYou see, I know you all might have seen some of my interviews and seen me on TV, but what I was saying the whole time is, what I was saying the whole time is, cuz I\u2019m not \u2014 [to stagehand] making it lighter, make it lighter, the second, the second light \u2014 I\u2019m not particularly angry or anything like that, but what I\u2019m saying is, they taking the idea of celebrity and trying to make me seem I was stupid or something. You know, when I take these meanings and shit, [crowd chants \u201cKanye\u201d] people they talk to you like you\u2019re stupid or something. And then you look back and say, you know, like I\u2019m not gonna call no names out, I\u2019m not going to mention Nike or nothing like that. I\u2019m not going to say no names or anything\u000a\u000aBut if you\u2019re a creative and you want to create, and you just want to create more, this is exactly what I\u2019ve been fighting for. So if you hear me talking about Louis Vuitton or the Gucci Group or anything like that. I\u2019m not dissing Louis Vuitton, I\u2019m not dissing the Gucci Group and shit. I\u2019m just saying, don\u2019t discriminate against me, because I\u2019m a black man or because I\u2019m a celebrity, and tell me that I can create, but not feel. Cuz you know damn well there aren\u2019t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing. They let Pharrell make those glasses, and we liked them, right? They let me make those shoes, and we liked them right?\u000a\u000aAnd they say, \u201cNo, no, no, nigger. Not no more. That\u2019s too much. That\u2019s too much. No, no, no, no, no, no, nigger not no more. That\u2019s way too much. That\u2019s way too much. Stay in your place. Sit in the front of that show and wear this jacket I made you. Stay in your place. Do what you get paid to do. Stay in your place. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself trying to chase your dreams. Save face. Save face.\u201d\u000a\u000aThat\u2019s why I got this fucking mask on, cuz I ain\u2019t worried about saving face. Fuck my face! Let\u2019s set \u2018em off. Pause. Now they finally got a headline. But fuck whatever my face is supposed to mean! Fuck whatever Kanye is supposed to mean! It\u2019s about my dreams. It\u2019s about everybody\u2019s dreams. It\u2019s about creating. It\u2019s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity, it\u2019s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit. Cuz these walls that I break down, these walls that I break down and we will\u000a\u000aAnd I\u2019m arguing with my friend Spike Jonze in the car cuz he said, Kanye, what you need to say is you\u2019re gonna try. You\u2019re gonna try to break them down. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re just going to do it. And I said, I am gonna do it! I told Kim seven years ago, I\u2019m gonna marry you! And I\u2019m telling you right now as I stand on this stage, all this shit that you heard me talking about, I\u2019m gonna come and back all that shit up. You don\u2019t know how hard it was to get the Nikes, that wasn\u2019t my fault. They try to control y\u2019all and try to control me. And when I was in my negotiations, they told me, \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate with celebrities.\u201d That\u2019s like a terrorist. They talk to you like it\u2019s fucking terrorist\u000a\u000aYou know, I just want to make something awesome. I just want to be awesome, and I want to hang around my awesome friends and change the fucking world, and that\u2019s exactly what I plan to do. And if you plan to do the same, put your hands in the air right now. If you just want to be awesome and make awesome shit and change the fucking world and this is what you plan to do\u000a\u000aLet\u2019s have a toast for the douchebags\u000a\u000aSource: Vulture\u000a

I'm just happy to be making music and happy to be able to perform this shit for you all. You know with this album, we didn't drop no single for radio; we ain't have no big NBA campaign or nothing like that, we ain't even got no cover. We just made some real music\u000a\u000aBack when I used to make albums and shit like a couple years ago, 3 years ago, like 4 years ago, we'd go away and work on an album for like 5 months or something, we'd always have to hold the album til like August or September for the perfect moment or some shit. Because it means that you're probably gonna sell more, get more audience and radio and shit\u000a\u000aBut, honestly, at this point, when I listen to radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more. And, honestly, at this point, I could give a fuck about selling a million records as long as I can put out an album this summer that you guys can rock to all motherfucking summer. Y'all don't tell me I'm gonna sell more records. Because at this point, I don't really give a fuck about outside opinions. All I give a fuck about is my clique-clique-clique....\u000a

VZane Lowe BBC Radio Interview Part 1
p851
V\u000aZane Lowe: Grab a seat, grab a seat. So, you remember this place? Graduation? I was also thinking about some of the other things we've done as well with the BBC, like Abbey Road sprung to mind with the strings.\u000a\u000aKanye West: Oh yeah. That was good. That suit was like, I would've worn something different if I could look back right now. I could still do a suit, I just wouldn't have done that exact lapel situation.\u000a\u000aZL: But talk about really putting yourself on the line with that. That was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and to give yourself that objective. What are your thoughts when you think back about Abbey Road, where...it's just nuts.\u000a\u000aKW: I thought it was good. I thought it was what I was supposed to do at that time. If I see something, if I see an opportunity, I'm gonna go for it. We're all gonna die one day.\u000a\u000aZL: Yeah, that's true.\u000a\u000aKW: So live like that. Live like you could die tomorrow. Go for it. Those steps have been the platforms that allowed me to make it this far.\u000a\u000aZL: And you have, man, and you're here. Six original albums of your own, a Throne record, various records with G.O.O.D. Music to talk about. But seriously, man, Yeezus. Bravo, dude. I mean, that is one of the most creative records of any genre I've heard in a very, very long time, and just in terms of your output, your most exciting-sounding record, I think.\u000a\u000aKW: Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, I feel I was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again, not having to speak with the textures of the time. Cause, you know, Cruel Summer is definitely Kanye West, and there's something weird and kind of off about "Mercy," like when it has the high-pitched (impersonates noise), that type of sound. It sounds like art still a little bit, even though it obviously was a radio smash.\u000a\u000aBut when I get into the idea, the trap drums and things like that, certain songs that are blatant radio hits, it's like I'm speaking with today's textures. If you look at it 200 years from now, it's not going to stand out in the way that 808s or Yeezus stands out, and can completely push or redefine or make people say, hey, I completely hate that, or I completely love that, but let me just think differently. Because everybody is bound to these -- no pun intended -- they're bound to sixteen bars or eight bars, and the normal radio thing.\u000a\u000aI was talking to Frank Ocean about this, and said, my mom got arrested for the sit-ins, and now we're more like the sit-outs. Like, sit off of radio, and say, hey radio, come to us. We need to find something new, because it's being controlled in a way, and manufactured in a way, that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as, like, something that's very formulaic.\u000a\u000aZL: So it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way? Having the peoples' ear, having peoples' attention for great music, to be able to say, well, if I'm not challenging them enough, I'm not challenging myself, not challenging radio, what am I doing?\u000a\u000aKW: Yeah. I'm not trying to regurgitate myself. I showed people that I understand how to make perfect. Dark Fantasy could be considered to be perfect. I know how to make perfect. But that's not what I'm here to do. I'm here to crack the pavement and make new grounds, sonically and society, culturally.\u000a\u000aZL: You've done that with Yeezus. It's fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now, because normally when I talk to artists about records of this nature, it's in the lead-up to something. So we're all kind of playing a guessing game, you know what I mean? You could tell me what you think of the record, but I'm trying to find my way around it, the audience probably won't have heard it. In this case, it's been out for a minute, so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight, too. You've seen what everyone else has had to say about this record, both good and bad. But I'm fascinated to know, today, how you would describe Yeezus, as someone who made it. How you would describe that record.\u000a\u000aKW: I just think that I'm a production person, I'm a product guy, I'm a producer. So if I'm working on a John Legend album, I'm gonna try to give John Legend the best home for him to stay in. And I'm gonna try to push Pusha T -- no pun intended once again, this keeps happening to me -- to make the thing that represents what I like about his music the most. And then for me as Kanye West, I gotta fuck shit up.\u000a\u000aZL: And you did, dude, seriously. From the minute it starts. I mean, seriously. (Plays opening to "On Sight"). It's disgusting.\u000a\u000aSo you're up in the loft probably at this point, and you're kicking around ideas, and you're putting things together, and this sound comes into your head, and you're like, this is what I'm looking for?\u000a\u000aKW: Nah. This is me going to the studio with Thomas and Guy-Manuel, who's Daft Punk. They had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there. This is just one session right here. This beat was originally like 14 minutes long, and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted, and I ended up making that the intro.\u000a\u000aZL: You know, I got a beef with you over this track. It's too short! I wanted more out of it. Cause it's one of the best beats on the record for me, and it feels like you're just getting warmed up. Was that kind of deliberate, to pull back after only a couple of verses and go, you know what, we're going to get on with the album now?\u000a\u000aKW: Nah, it's just what I felt, like it should be.\u000a\u000aZL: Just a dance thing.\u000a\u000aKW: And you know, originally "Blood on the Leaves" was supposed to be first.\u000a\u000aZL: Wow.\u000a\u000aKW: Which, psychologically, I know would have changed certain Yeezus naysayers about the album. It wasn't that time for me. I didn't want to come up there and perform. A lot of times, music can be presented as a service position. But I wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music.\u000a\u000aYou know, people go on a vacation and say, you got the drugs, you got the music, you got the wine? It's in that territory. But I wanted to speak up and say, okay, so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music. It's the only place where I actually have a deal, so I can only consistently make things in music. So I'm gonna take music and I'm gonna try to make it three-dimensional, like on Star Wars and the hologram'll pop up out of R2D2. I'm gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you, in a good or bad way. Whether it's, I'm going into a scream in the middle of the track because that's just the way I feel. But I'm not here to make easy listening, easy programmable music.\u000a\u000aZL: No. You're so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way. Like you talked about, the way you use your voice in different ways, you don't rely on conventional rhyming flows. Your opening line, "Yeezus season approaching," you know? "A monster's awoken." You're laying it out there, this isn't My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy part 2. I'm wilding out on this record, straight away.\u000a\u000a(Plays interlude from "On Sight"). And then from nowhere as well, we just get treated to these wonderful moments where, like you say, it's almost like a collage. Like you're sitting here going, you know, why can't I go into this? Why not?\u000a\u000aKW: You can.\u000a\u000aZL: And you did.\u000a\u000aKW: That's how life is. It's like a car crash. You could just be driving, and just out of nowhere it happens.\u000a\u000aZL: At what point did that very deliberate feel to the record, whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very contradictory but it works kind of way, at what point did that start to take shape? Because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole, the way it flips between one and the other. Was that in your head early on, or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record?\u000a\u000aKW: Well, I didn't reduce it. Rick Rubin reduced it. He's not a producer, he's a reducer. (Laughs).\u000a\u000aZL: But was it always part of the process for you, to say, why don't I take elements of this and this and just (claps hands together) bolt it together?\u000a\u000aKW: Yeah. It's just the way I was consuming information in my life at the time. Negative information to positive information, from the Internet, just going to the Louvre, going to furniture exhibits and understanding that, trying to open up and do interviews like this, learning more about architecture. Taking one thousand meetings, attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that. Getting no headway whatsoever. It was just that level of frustration. This is what frustration fucking sounds like.\u000a\u000aThis is what frustration sounds like. For me, as Kanye West, I would not be Kanye West if it wasn't for Michael Jackson. I was with Quincy Jones a couple days ago at John Legend's wedding. Quincy was telling me, it wasn't just Mike, but these guys broke down the barriers. Of course you know Michael Jackson, he had to fight to get his video played because he was black. This is Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson's not even black, he's Michael Jackson -- you know what I mean? He's so crazy, how can he even be classified as this black artist?\u000a\u000aSo for me, in my life and creativity it's been challenging and everything. But I was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights, what Michael Jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke. There would be no Kanye West if it wasn't for Michael Jackson - that allowed him to be that, right?\u000a\u000aNow let's take people who have issues with me as Kanye West. They classify my motivational speeches as rants - like "Why is he saying that? Why is he doing that?" Well I've reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. And I've got to a point that Michael Jackson did not break down. I have reached the glass ceiling - as a creative person, as a celebrity.\u000a\u000aWhen I say that it means I want to do product. I am a product person. Not just clothing but water bottle design, architecture, everything that you could think about. And I've been at it for 10 years, and I look around and I say, "Hey wait a second - there's no one around here in this space that looks like me." And if they are, they're quiet as fuck!\u000a\u000aSo that means - wait a second - now we're seriously in a Civil Rights movement. Like people used to joke about - remember our South Park photo - remember how funny that was? Do you think there would be a Givenchy in the hood if it wasn't for that South Park photo. But no one thinks about that - no one thinks about the names I got called for wearing tight jeans.\u000a\u000aZL: You reference that in the record, you talk about that. "No one's liked him since he's been wearing tight jeans." Everybody knows you brought back real rap. I mean you reference that in the record.\u000a\u000aKW: I'm saying y'all had all that, but I brought real rap back. I'm going to do dope things. And I wanna take this opportunity to speak to something, because I go to Hypebeast sometimes to look at the new things that're coming out. And every time my name goes up, there's a series of people who write just negative comments - they wanna joke around and say, "Why is he still trying? Why is he doing this?" They like diss me as a person for trying. Now mind you, I've brought 10 years of product that has added to humanity.\u000a\u000aAnd now, what they don't realize when I say "Hey this is Pusha T, this is what it is" I have to remind Pusha T that he's Pusha T. Because the radio, if they're not playing a song of his that has an R&B hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in clubs, it's like we forget about that Clipse album that meant everything.\u000a\u000aAnd the reason why I relate it to design and what we do in design is saying that's the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design - we looked at Clipse as the gods, and this is our soundtrack to creativity. And it's not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity. No knock to trap, cause I did "Can't Tell Me Nothing" - I like it. But it's been commercialized to the point where - and I'm not mentioning no names - but people used to use the term "R&B nigga" but then it was "rappers." But then rappers didn't wanna be no R&B nigga. Now the rappers is the new R&B niggas! The rapper's the new radio! Like where's the culture at? Where is the culture at?\u000a\u000aSo then I scream - and I'm sitting in the middle of it - whether I'm at a dinner with Anna Wintour, or I'm at a listening session with Pusha, or me and Virgil are in Rome giving designs to Fendi over and over and gettin' our designs knocked down. Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no. How many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant? Meaning when I see Hedi Slimane and it's all like, "OK this is my take on the world" - yeah he got some nice $5,000 jeans in there, some nice ones here and there, some good shit here and there.\u000a\u000aBut we culture. Rap the new rock n' roll! We culture! Rap is the new rock n' roll! We the rock stars!\u000a\u000aZL: It's been like that now for a minute.\u000a\u000aKW: It's been like that for a minute, Hedi Slimane! It's been like that for a minute. We the real rock stars, and I'm the biggest of all of 'em. I'm the number one rock star on the planet.\u000a\u000aCLICK HERE FOR PART 2\u000a

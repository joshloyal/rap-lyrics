I got few days left\nAnd I'm a make use of every single one\nUntill every singles done and till every record is sold\nAnd till every string is strung\nThey tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come\nDog... it's always been the same\nIt's all love\nLike no score in a tennis game\nFor the son of Dennis James\nOwner of the city downtown on a Friday\nStreets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway\nI roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up\nThey will close down richmond\nWith no down shiftin'\nHaters will say I'm adequate\nI think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit\n19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then\nSeamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts\nSo I put my 2 cents in\nTop of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus\nI'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in\nThey put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together\nFor they buy us out\nThey profit from the event\nWe handin' fliers out\nWe profit from the attempt to hand desires out\nBut rich is how we're all endin' up\nSo if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up\nHolla!\n"

You\nSay goodbye to people, people get sick and die when you\u2019re\nGone, and a lot of things just go by the way side. Then\nThere\u2019s all the strife, and power, and money, and control.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Ross Valory\n\nThey'll never truly know but\nThank you to all who try to understand\nNothing was the same\nThis album is dedicated to the memory of Evelyn Sher and Bruce Smith\n"

They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it.

this new girl late June or early July\nI called her a bunch of times but she barely replied\nNow it's December, I'm driving, and she's like \"Where's my hi?\"\nIt's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy\nSee that was a segue, I believe the matter\nIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter\nWhere the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\nDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up\nWhere girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in\nThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in\nAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing\nAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when\nBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\nInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\nCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\nWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!\n\n[Drake talking]\nYeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man\nA lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one\nBut just wait, nah mean, take it slow\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nForget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach\nShe lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet\nSince I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite\nShe doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat\nShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat\nShe's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet\nThen she says \"I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat\nI mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat\nI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good\nThere's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat\"\nOff this I'm kinda takin it back for a second\nI get her number she tells me to call her after this session\nAnd so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch\nUntil we end up sexin' and now my heart attached\nI'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern\nAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!\n\n[Drake talking]\nYeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right\nUh, ya man, it's what it is\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nAnd now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench\nShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench\nBut, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown\nAnd I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench\nShe tellin everyone I'mma hold here down\nTell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town\nAnd stupid me I just listen to her\nInstead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round\nBut then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch\nThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed\nWhen we were together it seeming like way back when\nBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\nSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa\nInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna\nAnd it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime\nI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime\n\n[Bridge (Drake talking)]\nI miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out]\n(give me a second to gather my thoughts)\n[Fades back in] Strolling in the park (Ho!)\nAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)\n(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)\nStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\n(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\n(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)\n\n[Verse 4: Drake]\nI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up\nNow Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup\nSo we can get back to them cognac nights\nWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right\nAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild\nThe winter came and blew his cold air through\nBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her\nBy the end of the week I would know that crew\nAnd we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene\nWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\nAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'\nWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen\nBut this Summer is different it's a two man operation\nGranted the fact that we one man short\nGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\nCause handlin' crack is a one man sport\nInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'\nI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'\nThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes\nI'm still solo and a long night draws to a close\nCause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\nWe'll never talk again, scary and true\nThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified\nIt's what I'm lookin for to carry me through\nYet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it\nOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit\nAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\nAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others\nYet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride\nThere's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive\n\n[Voice]\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\n"

My memory's never faded\nI can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it\nI am still here with who I started with\nThe game needed life, I put my heart in it\nI blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit\nCarry the weight for my city like a cargo ship\nI'm 23 with a money tree\nGrowin' more too, I just planted a hundred seeds\nIt's ironic cause my mother was a florist\nAnd that's how she met my pops\nAnd now my garden is enormous\n\"It's happenin', Penny Lane, just like you said!\"\nI avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead\nUh-huh, that's word to the millions that they puttin' up\nI'm trying to do better than good enough\n\n[Hook]\nWhat am I afraid of?\nThis is supposed to be what dreams are made of\nBut people I don't have the time to hang with\nAlways look at me and say the same shit\nThey say, \"you promised me you would never change\nYou promised me you would never change\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nAm I wrong for making light of my situation? Clap on\nWhen 40 got some shit for me to snap on\nNow that I'm on I don't really want to worry about gettin' back on\nI'm just trying to stay on, get my fuckin' buffet on\nI heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin' home\nAnd I be actin' like I don't know how to work a phone\nBut hit \"redial\", you'll see that I just called\nSome chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and\nPlus this woman that I messed with unprotected\nTexted sayin' she wished she would have kept it\nThe one that I'm layin' next to just looked over and read it\nMan, I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is\nI'm holdin' on by a thread it's like I'm high right now\nThe guy right now\nAnd you could tell by looking in my eyes right now\nThat nothin' really comes as a surprise right now\nCause we just havin' the time of our lives right now\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI live by some advice this girl Lissa told me\nThe other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me\nWhich made me question when I went missin'\nAnd when I started treatin' my friends different\nMaybe it was the fast paced switch up\nOr the two guns in my face durin' the stick up\nMaybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up\nBut in fact I haven't seen them since they locked Big Rich up\nI know, but same time I'm quick to forget\nI'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets\nBurn it all, burn it all, I'm startin' it fresh\nCause half the time I got it right I probably guessed\nDid I just trade free time for camera time?\nWill I blow all of this money baby, hammer time?\nYeah, I just need some closure\nAin't no turnin' back for me I'm in it 'til it's over\n"

Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang\nYeah we want it all, half was never the agreement\nWho would have thought the route we'd chosen would ever end up the scenic?\nI can relate to kids going straight to the league\nWhen they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed\nAnd that's around the time that your idols become your rivals\nYou make friends with Mike but got to A.I. him for your survival\nDamn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous\nCause we want to be them, and they want to be us\nSo on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment\nThat you take for granted, you can thank me now\nAnd oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome\nAt this point me is who I am trying to save myself from\nRappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them\nCause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from\nBut drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight\nExcept the niggas that I came with, they good for life\nThat's how you know it's going down in case another chance never comes around\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nShallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming\nI think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women\nI think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it\nCause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic\nMan, the good girls went silent on me\nThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me\nAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now\nThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me\nBut do I ever come up in discussion\nOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?\nDo I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?\nI'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson\nI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\nWho was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes\nThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\nAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul\nBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\nThat are ready to get married at hello\nBecause of what they allowed, where are they all now?\nI know they're somewhere watching\nSo I'm trying to make them proud\nSearching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me\nThey tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see\nI'm feeling like Nas: who am I to disagree?\nThey say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key\nThat's probably why I'm in this bitch shining\nJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment\nI rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded\nAnd the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry\nPoolside drinking, Margarita rounds\nShout out to my city though I hardly be in town\nI'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown\nAnd I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down\nI'm in a world where things are taken, never given\nHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\nAnd I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen\nSo while I'm still here in this position\n\n[Hook]\n"

Cause they know the promoter pays you, you wouldn't\nHave come if somebody hadn't of made you, you just looking\nForward to seeing women that played you and shitting\nOn the men they get engaged to, I swear it's like. Uh\nMore confidence and less fear. We can discuss it further\nWhen y'all manage to get here. Diddy here, O here\nSkinny here, Rex here and we just having one of them conversations\nAbout next year.

Today I realise that I'm not perfect\nEverything I did to get here wasn't really worth it\nWhy won't they just let me be great. You fall down seven\nTimes you stand up eight. Realise true happiness lies\nInside of you. Everyday give yourself a mental shampoo\nThe birds singing after the motherfukin` storm gone. If you\nWant to sing, you can always sing this song. Turn my swag\nOn, this my theme song, there`s 95 per-cent chance that I used to\nBe your ringtone.

And I'm thinking damn this is just the\nStart right now. Soulja Boy is going on a renegade\nIf life give you lemons make lemonade\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\n\n[Outro: Soulja Boy]\nUh, no one person on this earth can change their past\nBut every single person on this earth can start today\nAnd change their future.
